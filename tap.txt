frontend request backend
    how to request
        url:  localhost:8000
        method:post|get|patch|delete

making API means
    define response for particular request 

To make api
    we have to follow two steps
        make Router
        use that router to index.js(main app)


for one request we must have only one response


url = localhost:8000/a/b/c?name=nitan&age=30&isMarried=false
url = route?query
route=baseUrl/routeParam1/routeParam2/....
query =name=nitan&age=30&isMarried=false

every things in url are string
